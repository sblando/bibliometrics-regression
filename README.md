# 📊 Bibliometric Regression Analysis of Library Marketing Impact (2010–2015)

This project performs a **bibliometric linear regression analysis** to explore the relationship between the **number of indexed research documents** and the **total citation impact** of authors publishing in the field of **library marketing**.

The analysis relies on bibliometric data extracted from **Web of Science (WoS)** and processed through **InCites (Clarivate Analytics)**.

## 🔍 Boolean Search Strategy

### Boolean query used to retrieve data:
 
> ("library marketing" OR "marketing in libraries" OR "library promotion") AND (impact OR evaluation OR   effectiveness OR engagement) NOT (editorial OR "book review" OR commentary)

###  Web of Science TS field equivalent:

> (((TS = "library marketing") OR (TS = "marketing in libraries")) OR (TS = "library promotion")) AND((((TS = impact) OR (TS = evaluation)) OR (TS = effectiveness)) OR (TS = engagement)) NOT((((TS = editorial) OR (TS = "book review")) OR (TS = commentary)))
